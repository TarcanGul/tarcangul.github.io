Modern music is evolved around music software. You might heard the particular type of software that is common among all of the electronic music produers (and other types of musicians nonetheless) is a *DAW (Digital Audio Workstations)*. DAWs have many components which helps the user (the musician) to make any composition:
- The sequencer
- The mixer
- The arrangement area

Many examples for DAW's can be Ableton, Logic, Reason and my favorite, FL Studio.

For DAW's, one of the main components is the sequencer where the user can choose short bursted sounds (usually drum sounds or short samples) and determine the *sequence* on how the chosen sounds are going to play. It allows the user to express the sounds and the ryhthm.
